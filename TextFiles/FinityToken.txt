The Finity smart contract is an ERC20-compliant token with added functionality for burning tokens and supporting off-chain approvals via EIP-2612 permits.
It is designed to serve as the native token for the Finity Network, with a total supply of 8 billion tokens minted to a specified multi-signature wallet at deployment.

Features:

ERC20 Standard: Implements the standard functionality of ERC20 tokens, including transferring and querying balances.
ERC20 Burnable: Allows token holders to burn their tokens, reducing the total supply.
ERC20 Permit: Enables gasless approvals using EIP-2612, allowing token allowances to be set via cryptographic signatures instead of transactions.
Ownable2Step: Provides a robust ownership management mechanism where ownership can be securely transferred in a two-step process, ensuring secure multi-sig wallet integration.
Key Components

Constructor
The constructor initializes the contract with the following parameters:
_multiSigWallet: The address of the multi-signature wallet that will initially own all minted tokens and the contract itself. This address must be non-zero.

Functionality:

Mints a fixed total supply of 10 billion tokens to the _multiSigWallet address.
Sets _multiSigWallet as the initial owner of the contract.
Functions

Standard ERC20 Functions:

transfer: Transfer tokens to another address.
approve: Approve a spender to use a specified number of tokens.
transferFrom: Transfer tokens on behalf of an account.
balanceOf: Get the token balance of an account.
Burning Tokens:burn(amount): Burns the caller's tokens, reducing the total supply.
burnFrom(account, amount): Burns tokens from a specified account, provided the caller has sufficient allowance.

Permit Approvals:
permit: Allows token allowances to be set by submitting a signed message, enabling gasless transactions.
Ownership Management:

The contract uses Ownable2Step for managing ownership transitions, providing secure transfer of ownership to a new owner in two steps:
transferOwnership: Initiates ownership transfer.
acceptOwnership: Completes the transfer.
